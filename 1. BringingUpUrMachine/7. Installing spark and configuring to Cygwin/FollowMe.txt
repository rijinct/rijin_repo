Already downloaded spark and extracted in "C:\Users\rithomas\Desktop\NokiaCemod\Cemod_software\Spark"

so, pyspark is in spark\bin folder and spark-shell also. Will add it in ENV variable and export it so that I can run it from anywhere. 

to start spark, run spark-shell in cmd promot. In cygwin its not going in that prompt
