Add the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY in env variable so that you can download package using pip and all


HTTP_PROXY="http://10.144.1.10:8080"
HTTP_PROXY="http://10.144.1.10:8080"

I have removed the above from user variable in env settings, coz couldnt do pip install with local internet. Note: It should be in user variable not in env variable
